## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I am creating an on-campus recruitment sign-in for my work at the WashU Career Center. They are never able to gather the contact info from recruiters because they aren't the people the Employer Relations team talks to. 
### Features
Sign-in features. Automatic email upon sign-in. Ability to export to excel lists. 
### Technologies
I think I'll need to use Java, MAMP, HTML/CSS, and Flask. 

### What I'll Have to Learn
I'll need to figure out how to allow the sign-in to trigger an automatic email and export selected lists to excel sheets.
